Basics:

Rays are generated for each pixel on target screen. Each ray is traced from the eye through the pixel, onto the first obstructing object, they the ray reflects on the surface, and the process continues.



The scene for each frame is built from scratch


Custom objects with arbitarry intersection and texture mapping functions must be supported


Possible headlight defined on raytracer


Other lights are a part of the scene


Envisioned usage:

Raytracer::Ref raytracer = Raytracer::getDefault();

raytrater->enablePhotonMapping();

raytracer->setPerspective(...);

Screne::Ref scene = raytracer->newScene();

scene->addObject();

raytracer->render(scene);





Definitions:

Scene
  addObject(Object::RefArg);
